# TransitAnalyzer

TransitAnalyzer is a geospatial machine learning project that analyzes public transport connectivity at the ward level. Trained on Delhi's GTFS transit and population data, it classifies wards as **Underserved**, **Optimal**, or **Cluttered** based on route and stop density, population, and spatial features. The web app uses a pre-trained model to display predictions and insights on an interactive map using Streamlit.

## üìä Model Overview

- Trained using a multi-class classifier (Random Forest, XGBoost) on features derived from GTFS and demographic data.
- Achieved **96% accuracy** and a **macro F1-score of 0.89** on the test set.
- Supports explainability using SHAP and feature importance analysis.

## üîç Feature Importance

The model ranked the following features as most important for classification:

| Feature               | Importance |
|-----------------------|------------|
| `stop_density`        | **0.3761** |
| `route_count`         | 0.1790     |
| `route_density`       | 0.1447     |
| `population_density`  | 0.1272     |
| `avg_fare`            | 0.0947     |
| `overlap_score`       | 0.0767     |
| `border_overlap_score`| 0.0016     |

## üó∫Ô∏è Model Predictions on Delhi

The model predicted coverage classifications for each of Delhi‚Äôs 367 wards:

- **Cluttered:** 305 wards (~83%)  
- **Underserved:** 36 wards (~10%)  
- **Optimal:** 26 wards (~7%)

These predictions reveal a significant imbalance in stop/route distribution and can inform targeted interventions.
